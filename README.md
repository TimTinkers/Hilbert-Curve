# Hilbert-Curve
A simple program for generating steps in the Hilbert Curve.

Built using the LibGDX engine, this has simple camera controls to help with viewing the figures. Use the scroll wheel to zoom, and WASD to maneuver the camera.

Here are some images of each progressive step in generating the fractal:
